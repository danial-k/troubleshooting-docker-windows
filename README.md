# Viewing Docker engine logs
The Docker engine on Windows 10 runs inside a Hyper-V virtual machine.  To examine the docker logs in real-time, one approach is to mount a Docker container to the root directory (```/```) of the Hyper-V virtual machine and inspect logs from inside the container.
To create a new container run:
```shell
docker run -i -t --name dockerdesktop --mount type=bind,src=/,dst=/dockerdesktop ubuntu bash
```
This will start an interactive (```-i```) teletype (```-t```) session connecting to the container's ```bash``` and will mount the ```src``` of ```/``` from the host (the Hyper-V Linux VM, not the Windows host) to the ```dst``` of ```/dockerdesktop``` on the new ```ubuntu``` container called ```dockerdesktop``` (specified by ```--name```).

Once the container has started and you are able to run shell commands, run the following to view in real-time the logs generated by the docker engine:
```shell
tail -f /dockerdesktop/var/log/docker.log
```
This command uses the [tail](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tail) utility in follow mode (```-f```) to watch entries being added to the end of the log file.  Note that other log files may exist in the directory that may be of value.  Also note that ```/var/log``` will be log location for the Ubunutu container while ```/dockerdesktop/var/log``` will be the log location for the mounted Hyper-V vm.
